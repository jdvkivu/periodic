# periodic
Periodic is a package of scheduled configurable scripts that will perform all kinds of system health checks and aggregates script outputs in one report. These scripts are ported from FreeBSD where periodic is part of the FreeBSD system itself, see [FreeBSD periodic man pages](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=periodic&manpath=FreeBSD+11.1-RELEASE+and+Ports).
